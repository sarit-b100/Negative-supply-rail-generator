# Negative-supply-rail-generator
Simulation of an analog circuit capable of generating negative supply voltage of comparable magnitude to the positive input voltage. 
The negative supply voltage is provided across a capacitor which limits the source and sink currents.This issue is resolved by connecting an astable multivibrator 
which periodically recharges the capacitor.
